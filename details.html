						<p>“You realize that every kid in this city could have been immunized for the cost of that one transplant.” Later, the dean put his hand on my shoulder and said, “We’re a state-funded school, and we’ve been warned by the legislature and the governor to take on tobacco at our own peril.” Then he added, “But if a student were to engage in such activities, we wouldn’t get in the way.” So, I worked with some committed faculty to make Virginia Commonwealth University a smoke-free institution. That experience taught me that everything I loved about patient care could be amplified at a policy level.

From there, I retooled my career plan, moving from the discipline of molecular neurobiology to health services research and quality. That trajectory took me from academia to the Veterans Health Administration, ultimately leading as the Under Secretary for Health at the VA. From there, I went to HCA.

Last year, when The Joint Commission was seeking a leader with academic, government, and large health system experience, I realized that I had never seen a job description more consistent with my background. So, here I am.

						<p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form,
							by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage
							of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem
							Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator
							on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures,
							to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition,
							injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc</p>
